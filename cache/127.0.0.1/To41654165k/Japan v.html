    <p>content:Japan Football Association President Kozo Tashima gives an online interview on March 28, 2022. (Kyodo)    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan Football Association President Kozo Tashima said Monday he will ask the government to prepare domestic legislation that would ensure Japan national team matches are shown on free-to-air networks.        Japan secured their seventh straight World Cup finals berth on Thursday by beating Australia 2-0 in Sydney in Group B of the final Asian qualifiers. The game, however, was only shown in Japan through streaming service provider DAZN.        The inflated Asian Football Confederation-administered fee for the broadcasting rights of the final round of qualifiers meant Japan's away games were only aired live by DAZN.        "We need the government to make a move," said Tashima, who said the JFA had received complaints.        He cited Great Britain, where high-demand sporting events such as the World Cup and Olympic Games must be shown on free-to-air services.        "The most disappointing thing is children not getting the chance to watch," Tashima said.</p>
