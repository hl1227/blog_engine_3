(Mainichi/Koji Hyodo)    NAGOYA -- A superintendent at central Japan's Aichi Prefectural Police was arrested March 28 for using a smartphone to allegedly covertly film a female high school student on a train.    The prefectural police made an on-site arrest of Toshihiko Senoo, 59, the head of its fourth investigation division and a resident of the Aichi Prefecture city of Kariya, on suspicion of violating prefectural nuisance prevention ordinance. He has reportedly admitted to the allegations.    Senoo is accused of taking secret footage of the student including her lower body while she sat across from him in a four-seat booth on a train traveling from JR Kanayama Station to JR Atsuta Station on the Tokaido Line at around 10:50 p.m. on March 28.    Police said the suspect was on his way home from a post-work dinner with colleagues in Nagoya's Naka Ward. Other passengers approached Senoo after noticing he was acting suspicious, and they restrained him after getting off the train at JR Minami-Odaka Station. Station staff made an emergency report to police.    Senoo joined the police in 1981, and since March 2021 he has been head of the fourth investigation division that probes crime syndicates.    The prefectural police's chief inspector general Masahiko Hayashi said, "It is extremely regrettable that a senior police officer has caused such an incident. We sincerely apologize to the victim, and to all prefectural residents."    The prefectural police will take disciplinary measures following the results of an investigation.
