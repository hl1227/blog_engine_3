FUKUOKA -- A park in this southwest Japan city known for its cherry blossoms is being lit up for the first time in three years after the illumination had been called off as a coronavirus infection countermeasure.     Maizuru Park in the city of Fukuoka's Chuo Ward has limited its illumination to Korokan square, the ruins of a trading post, due to COVID-19. On March 27, cherry trees were seen in full bloom in the city of Fukuoka -- the earliest in Japan. During the night, beautiful sakura trees were reflected on the water's surface at a moat within the premises of the park, which includes the ruins of Fukuoka Castle.     The area is being lit up between 6 and 9 p.m. until April 3. The Fukuoka Castle cherry blossom festival executive committee is calling on residents to refrain from holding sakura-viewing parties.
