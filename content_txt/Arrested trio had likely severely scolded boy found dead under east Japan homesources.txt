Saitama Prefectural Police headquarters (Mainichi/Takuya Suzuki)    SAITAMA -- The mother of a 5-year-old boy who was found dead under the floor of a home in east Japan and two people who lived with her, all of whom are under arrest, are believed to have severely scolded the boy on a daily basis and made him sit in a seiza style on his knees for long periods, investigative sources have disclosed.    Under arrest are the boy's mother Chika Kakimoto, and Hiroki Niwa, 34, and Yoko Ishii, 54, who lived with her in the city of Honjo in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo.    Saitama Prefectural Police served the three fresh arrest warrants on March 26 on suspicion of throwing Kakimoto's son Ayumu through the air and otherwise assaulting him in a room at their home in January this year, resulting in his death. They are suspected of abandoning the boy's body on the ground under the floor of the home the following day. Police had earlier arrested the three on suspicion of abandonment of a corpse.    The Honjo Municipal Government received a report about the family in September 2021 from a restaurant in the city based on suspicions that Ayumu was being abused. Prefectural police suspect that the three had repeatedly severely scolded the boy at home and elsewhere, possibly leading to assault, and they are continuing to investigate the background details.
