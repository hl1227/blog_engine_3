(Kyodo)    PLANICA, Slovenia (Kyodo) -- Beijing Winter Olympic ski jumping gold medalist Ryoyu Kobayashi claimed his second overall World Cup title on Sunday after placing eighth in the season-ending round in Slovenia.        The 25-year-old Kobayashi, who won men's individual normal hill gold and large hill silver in Beijing, totaled 1,621 World Cup points to finish 106 ahead of Germany's Karl Geiger, with Norway's large hill Olympic champion Marius Lindvik a further 284 back in third.        Kobayashi won eight World Cup rounds this season on the way to his first overall crown since 2019, when he became the first men's overall champion from outside Europe.        "It was a tough season as I wasn't able to go home (to Japan) even once," Kobayashi said. "Winning both (the Olympics and World Cup), it was a fantastic season. I'm thrilled."        Lindvik won the final World Cup round in Planica with 455.1 points, following jumps of 241.5 and 245.5 meters, while Japan's Yukiya Sato placed second, jumping 236.5 and 242.5 meters to score 446.8 and claim his first podium in two seasons.
