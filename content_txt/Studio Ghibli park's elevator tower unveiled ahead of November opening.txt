The elevator tower renovated for the Studio Ghibli Inc. theme park, is seen at Expo Memorial Park in Nagakute, Aichi Prefecture, on March 23, 2022. (Mainichi/Shiho Sakai)    NAGAKUTE, Aichi -- The elevator tower at the Studio Ghibli Inc. theme park slated to open in November at a memorial park in this central Japan city was unveiled on March 23, invoking images of the worlds seen in beloved Ghibli movies including "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" and "Howl's Moving Castle."    The elevator tower at Expo Memorial Park in the Aichi Prefecture city of Nagakute, standing about 28 meters tall, is a renovated version of an existing tower, and it functions as a clock tower. Looking like something out of a Studio Ghibli film, it sits at the park's main gate. The ongoing decoration of the tower will be completed before the opening.    Though the theme park's opening isn't for another eight months, the elevator tower's operation commenced on March 23 as it's part of the route to an ice-skating rink at the expo park. Yuzuki Matsuura, 6, who attended the unveiling ceremony, said of the tower, "The (turret) clock is impressive."    (Japanese original by Shiho Sakai, Nagoya News Center)
