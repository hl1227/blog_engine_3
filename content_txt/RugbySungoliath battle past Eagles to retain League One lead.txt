Tevita Li, right, scores a try for Tokyo Sungoliath in their League One win over Yokohama Canon Eagles at Showa Denko Dome in Oita on March 27, 2022. (Kyodo)    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Late tries from Tevita Tatafu helped Tokyo Sungoliath to hold off the stubborn Yokohama Canon Eagles 40-27 to remain on top of League One on Sunday.        Leading 28-27 at Showa Denko Dome in southwestern Japan's Oita Prefecture, Tatafu used his pace and giant frame to make his team's late pressure pay off by grounding the ball at either corner in the 73rd and 79th minutes.        The Eagles went ahead 12 minutes in when lock Liaki Moli played in flyhalf Jumpei Ogura, whose quick feet gained yards before flanker Kobus van Dyk embarked on a free run to score with SP Marais adding the extras.        Sungoliath found their way through in the 20th minute. Fullback Damian McKenzie got a return pass from wing Seiya Ozaki down the right to go over before hitting the post with his conversion from a relatively easy angle.        After scoring a penalty each, Sungoliath got their second try following a superb cross-field kick from captain and Japan center Ryoto Nakamura. It found Tevita Li by the left touchline, and the wing fought off three tackles to cross. McKenzie added the extras this time from a difficult position and a penalty a few minutes later.        Sungoliath's defense remained disjointed, however, and Eagles scored after the hooter from a lineout with Ogura playing in Marais, who was unchallenged as he went over. The fullback scored the conversion as Eagles ended the first stanza trailing a narrow 18-17 deficit.        A well-worked lineout just inside the opposition half handed Sungoliath their third try in the 56th minute with hooker Shunta Nakamura the scorer. McKenzie made it a 28-20 lead, but the Eagles ceased to go away.        Capitalizing on a succession of Sungoliath defensive penalties, Kazufumi Yamasuga's quick restart was finished off by Moli, with Marais's third conversion making it 28-27.        But they had no answer to the unstoppable Tatafu, who shrugged off a defender on each try to seal the victory.        Elsewhere, Kubota Spears Funabashi Tokyo Bay battered NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes Osaka 34-3 to stay second on 44 points, two behind Sungoliath, with Finau Tupa getting two tries.        Jack Cornelsen scored a last-minute try as third-place Saitama Panasonic Wild Knights edged Shizuoka Blue Revs 26-25 to remain unbeaten on the pitch this season. Their two losses were forfeits when the coronavirus prevented them from fielding a team.
