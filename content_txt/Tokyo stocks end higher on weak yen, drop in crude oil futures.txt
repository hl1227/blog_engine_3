(Mainichi)    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo stocks ended higher Tuesday as a weak yen against the U.S. dollar lifted exporter shares, while worries over soaring inflation receded somewhat following an overnight drop in crude oil futures.        The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 308.53 points, or 1.10 percent, from Monday at 28,252.42. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 18.29 points, or 0.93 percent, higher at 1,991.66.        Gainers were led by transportation equipment, marine transportation and service issues.        The dollar hovered around the mid-123 yen range, meeting some selling a day after it soared to top the 125 yen line for the first time in nearly seven years.        At 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 123.57-59 yen compared with 123.89-99 yen in New York and 123.92-93 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Monday.        The euro was quoted at $1.0999-1000 and 135.92-96 yen against $1.0982-0992 and 136.06-16 yen in New York and $1.0951-0953 and 135.71-75 yen in Tokyo late Monday afternoon.        The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond inched down 0.005 percentage point from Monday's close to 0.245 percent, after an operation by the Bank of Japan to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year government bonds at a fixed rate was met with investors securing the safe-haven debt.        The BOJ's operation since Monday came as the yield neared the upper target set by the central bank of around 0.250 percent.        The benchmark Nikkei tracked overnight advances on Wall Street, regaining the 28,000 mark as export-oriented shares ranging from electric appliance manufacturers to automakers advanced. A weaker yen boosts their overseas profits when repatriated.        The yen accelerated its fall Monday after the BOJ announced an emergency bond-buying operation. The central bank has maintained its aggressive monetary easing, fueling expectations of a widening interest rate gap between Japan and the United States, where its counterpart has been tightening policy.        "The weak yen supported exporter issues throughout the day on expectations that the recent downward trend will boost corporate revenue," said Masahiro Yamaguchi, head of investment research at SMBC Trust Bank.        Although the yen's weakness is a boon for the Tokyo stock market and some businesses, it has simultaneously raised concerns for the import-reliant Japanese economy.        The drop in crude oil futures was also a positive factor for the market as it eased recent concerns over inflation and its impact on the global economy, with expectations that it will serve as a tailwind for Japanese firms reliant on imported oil, analysts said.        But the market moved little within positive territory in the afternoon amid a lack of fresh trading cues, as investors looked toward the upcoming cease-fire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Yamaguchi said.        On the First Section, advancing issues outnumbered decliners 1,466 to 635, while 77 ended unchanged.        Among exporters, Nissan Motor gained 7.8 yen, or 1.4 percent, to 547.9 yen, while Honda Motor rose 79 yen, or 2.3 percent, to 3,562 yen. Panasonic was up 23.0 yen, or 1.9 percent, at 1,221.0 yen.        Lower oil futures weighed on refiners and petroleum explorers. Eneos Holdings fell 10.1 yen, or 2.1 percent, to 479.7 yen and Idemitsu Kosan declined 50 yen, or 1.4 percent, to 3,510 yen.        Trading volume on the main section rose to 1,362.36 million shares from Monday's 1,110.24 million.
