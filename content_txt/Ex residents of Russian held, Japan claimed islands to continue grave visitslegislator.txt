(Mainichi)    Japan Innovation Party (Nippon Ishin) legislator Muneo Suzuki said on March 26 that he had confirmed with Russia's ambassador to Japan that visits to family graves by former residents of the Russian-held, Japan-claimed Northern Territories off Hokkaido would continue.    The upper house member's remark came after Russia severed negotiations on a postwar peace treaty with Japan and announced a halt to a visa-free program for former residents of the disputed islands following Tokyo's sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.    Suzuki said he met the same evening with people including representatives of former residents of the islands in the city of Nemuro in Hokkaido, and explained to them that he had confirmed in talks with Mikhail Galuzin, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Japan, on March 22 that grave visits would still go ahead.    "What is being suspended is projects from 1991 onward, and the grave visits are separate from that," he said.    At the same time, comments from former residents of the four disputed islands included that the Northern Territories issue "has entered a tunnel with no visible exit," and that "there has not been a single step forward in 77 years (since the end of World War II)."
