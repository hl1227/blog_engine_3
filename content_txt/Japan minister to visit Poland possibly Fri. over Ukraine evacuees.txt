Japanese Justice Minister Yoshihisa Furukawa. (Kyodo)    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan will send its justice minister to Poland possibly this week as part of preparations to accept more people fleeing Ukraine due to the Russian invasion, government sources said Monday.        With the dispatch on Friday at the earliest, the government is also considering transporting evacuees and Japanese nationals from Ukraine on a government plane, the sources said.        Justice Minister Yoshihisa Furukawa, who will be sent as a special envoy, is expected to meet with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and high-ranking officials during his stay in the European country, which shares a long border with Ukraine, according to the sources.        Furukawa will also likely visit the southeastern Polish city of Rzeszow, where Japan has set up a temporary office, to inspect how refugees from Ukraine are being received, they said.        Earlier this month, Japan began accepting Ukrainians fleeing the war launched by Russia more than a month ago as part of its humanitarian response.        The government has said they can come to Japan even if they have no relatives or acquaintances who can act as a guarantor, shifting from its original policy of requiring them to have one.        "Japan will provide support for Ukrainians facing a national crisis as much as possible," Kishida said Monday in a House of Councillors committee session.        Kishida also said the government will set up a team in charge of assisting evacuees in Poland.        When Kishida held talks with Morawiecki on Thursday in Belgium, he said that Japan will speed up the pace of accepting people from the war-torn country.        Since March 2, when Kishida announced the policy of Japan accepting evacuees from Ukraine, more than 200 have been granted entry.        The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said 3.86 million people had fled Ukraine as of Sunday. Poland has become by far the largest recipient of the refugees.
