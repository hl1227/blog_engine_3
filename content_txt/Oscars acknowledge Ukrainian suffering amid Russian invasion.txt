(UPI/Kyodo)    LOS ANGELES (Kyodo) -- A moment of silence was held during the 94th U.S. Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, to acknowledge Ukraine's suffering caused by Russia's invasion since late February.        The silent message that ran on TV screens also called for humanitarian aid. Some attendees wore the colors of the Ukrainian flag as a tribute.        "We'd like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders," the message said.        "While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water, and emergency services. Resources are scarce, and we -- collectively as a global community -- can do more. We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandwithUkraine."        The request was preceded by a speech by Ukrainian-born American actress Mila Kunis, who referred to the war without mentioning Ukraine or Russia.        "Recent global events have left many of us feeling gutted," she said. "Yet when you witness the strength and dignity of those facing such devastation, it's impossible to not be moved by their resilience. One cannot help but be in awe of those who find strength to keep fighting through unimaginable darkness."        Kunis, who immigrated to the United States as a child, has raised around $35 million to support the war-torn country with husband and actor Ashton Kutcher.        According to the United Nations, the Russian invasion has caused 10 million people to flee their homes.        Some attendees, such as American actor Samuel Jackson and South Korean actress Youn Yuh Jung, wore light blue ribbons to signify their support for the refugees.        British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, nominated as the best actor in a leading role for "The Power of the Dog," wore a button with the Ukrainian colors of blue and yellow.        A few mentioned Ukraine directly, such as Francis Ford Coppola who shouted "Viva Ukraine!" at the end of his speech acknowledging the 50th anniversary of "The Godfather," which he directed.        Amy Schumer, one of the main presenters of the evening, mentioned that there is "a genocide going on" in Ukraine near the end of the three-hour show.
