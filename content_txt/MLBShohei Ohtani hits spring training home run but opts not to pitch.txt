Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels hits a solo home run in the first inning of a spring training baseball game against the Chicago White Sox on March 26, 2022, in Glendale, Arizona. (Kyodo)    GLENDALE, Arizona (Kyodo) -- Shohei Ohtani blasted his first home run of spring training Saturday, but the two-way superstar decided not to make his scheduled pitching start in a 12-3 win over the Chicago White Sox.        Leading off as designated hitter, Ohtani went long on the first pitch of the game, clearing right-center field at Camelback Ranch outside Phoenix. He drew a walk and struck out in his other plate appearances.        The 27-year-old had been penciled in to pitch against the White Sox but chose to change his schedule after being named the Angels' Opening Day starter.        Manager Joe Maddon told MLB.com Ohtani will work out over the next two days and make a Cactus League start on Thursday, which will be his last tune-up before Opening Day against the Houston Astros at Angel Stadium April 7.        "He'd prefer to do it this way, and I'm 100 percent supportive of it," Maddon said.        Ohtani said he wanted to make sure he had enough rest before his first Opening Day start in America's majors.        "I felt good in my last outing, and I still have a lot of days in between, so I'm going to adjust by throwing live batting practice sessions or bullpen sessions," the reigning American League MVP told MLB.com.        Elsewhere in spring training, Yoshitomo Tsutsugo went 3-for-3 with an RBI as DH for the Pittsburgh Pirates, who lost 14-5 to the Baltimore Orioles, while Cincinnati Reds outfielder Shogo Akiyama went 1-for-3 in a 2-1 win over the San Francisco Giants.        Kohei Arihara, who has a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers, gave up five runs in two innings of relief in an 8-7 loss to the Colorado Rockies.        Gosuke Kato, on a minor deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, went 1-for-2 in a 10-9 win over the New York Yankees.
